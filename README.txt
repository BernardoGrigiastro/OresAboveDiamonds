This is the open source code of the Minecraft mod Ores Above Diamonds. Feel free to use it, contribute to it, or do anything else you want with it.
1.16.4 doesn't have working ore generation right now. The ores don't spawn, and I'm trying to find a workaround but I've been pretty busy lately and I am not exactly the most efficient programmer so it's probably going to take a lot of time unfortunately.
